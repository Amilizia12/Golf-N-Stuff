For the presentation will be hosting the game on itch.io what will be on any internet browser. The buisness layer is consitented of three parts. The first part is the Game state manager what manages what state of the game you are in. There are five states in total, the waiting,putting,end,pause, and aiming states. The second part of the buisness layer is the levels what are just the various differnt levels that are made for the game. The third part is the assets what are the assets used to make the levels and decorate them. then the data layer is the layer for our database what will collect user scores from the game.
