## 1. Description


## 2. Verification (Tests)
## 2.1. Unit Test
### 2.1.1
  + We have utilized NUnit testing framework for the C# .NET language. We also utilize TestTools derived from the UnityEngine library to assist in the execution of tests in their respective environment.
### 2.1.2
  + [A link to the tests](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/tree/main/Assets/Tests)
### 2.1.3 
  + An example test case would be testing to see if the correct state change has occured when requested through code. [Here](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/blob/main/Assets/Tests/PlayMode/TestStateChange.cs) is an example of a Play Mode test where we do such a thing.

### Jacob Kaiser
**Menu:**

## Reflections
**Jacob Kaiser:**
Jacob's feedback primarily focused on the UI and mechanics of the game. While he did not have an issue with the menu or levels, he proposed ideas on how to adjust certain asepcts and make it easier. First, he suggested we change the background of the Menu page to match the Options page because it looked nicer and would match the whole theme of theg ame. Second, he proposed a pause button because he did not see that option. Third, he proposed the mechanics of the game to reset the ball faster when it hits out of bounds because that took quite a bit during levels 1, 2, and 3 when he would go off course.

**Annika Hurst:**
Annika had mixed feelings about the overall game. She methioned multiple times that the UI and graphics were really informative and fun. She had no issues learning to play though
while playing, she said she ran into some problems. Annika talked a lot about how had the game was. When hitting the ball she struggleed to hit with just the right speed. This
would cause the ball to go way out of bounds or on the flip, just a couple inches. She was using a track pad rather then a mouse and further options should be added to adjust for
different play styles/hardware. Lastly Annika menthioned the fact the when aiming, the ball could get lost behind a wall. This could easily be fixed with some future shaders. 

**Sierra Morales***
Sierra's feedback was very constructive and started off with how easy it is to read the text from the menus and the instructions in game. The animations are a "nice tough" Sierra exclaims. She notices that the option menu is missing "actual options" and perhaps customization would be a good fit here. Sierra shared that the game would be better if it had a full screen option. While in the game she noticed that the simple art style was very attractive. The controls were very intuitive and well explained. Then she continues with the later levels can get frustrating due to difficulty and could be made easier. Lastly Sierra explained how she was expecting more of a celebration after scoring a hole.

**Mia Visser**
Mias reaction was mostly positive. She really liked the "funny mascot" that we have in almost all animations throughout the game. She really likes the background music, and says it's calming with a nice beat. She didn't see the second level signs and this caused a bit of frustration in the later harder levels. She also explained the level difficulty increases way too fast. Overall the controls are intuitive and easy to figure out and very rewarding when you get a hole in one!

**Summary:**
