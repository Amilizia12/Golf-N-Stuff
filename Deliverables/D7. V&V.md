## Interview Results
### Jacob Kaiser
**Menu:**
- How does the menu look?
  - looks good and the terrain too
- Are the colors clashing?
  - the only thing is the Golf-N-Stuff background is a different color than the options background, other than that, you can see everything clearly
- What do you think about the animations?
  - like the font a lot and the animations are cool
- Is there anything missing in the menu section?
  - in the options, there should be an option to change volume
- How would you rate the overall ease of use (1 to 10) of the main menu?
  - 9 out of 10
- Could you give an overall score of 1-10 and why?
  - 8 because it makes sense and is easy to follow

**Game:**
- How does the game look? 
  - the game looks awesome. The terrains are well designed too
- What are your thoughts on the levels (too colorful, too easy, too hard, etc.)?
  - I like the variety of them
- What could be improved?
  - maze level color looks weird
  - making the pars realistic for each level
  - having sizzle sounds for the lava level
  - having a pause button
- How are the mechanics? Any improvements there?
  - overall, good
  - could improve level 1, 2, and 3 when rolling on the grass to reset the ball faster because sometimes you roll down the hill and it takes a bit to reset the ball
- How would you rate the overall ease of use (1 to 10)?
  - 7 or 8
- What do you think about the graphics? Any improvements?
  - I think they are good. I like them a lot
- Are there any features missing that you expected?
  - Just the volume controls

## Reflections
**Jacob Kaiser:**
Jacob's feedback primarily focused on the UI and mechanics of the game. While he did not have an issue with the menu or levels, he proposed ideas on how to adjust certain asepcts and make it easier. First, he suggested we change the background of the Menu page to match the Options page because it looked nicer and would match the whole theme of theg ame. Second, he proposed a pause button because he did not see that option. Third, he proposed the mechanics of the game to reset the ball faster when it hits out of bounds because that took quite a bit during levels 1, 2, and 3 when he would go off course.

**Summary:**
