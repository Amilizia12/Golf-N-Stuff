## Interview Results
### Jacob Kaiser
**Menu:**
- How does the menu look?
  - looks good and the terrain too

  - like the font a lot and the animations are cool
- Is there anything missing in the menu section?
  - in the options, there should be an option to change volume
- How would you rate the overall ease of use (1 to 10) of the main menu?
  - 9 out of 10

  - 7 or 8

## Reflections
**Jacob Kaiser:**
Jacob's feedback primarily focused on the UI and mechanics of the game. While he did not have an issue with the menu or levels, he proposed ideas on how to adjust certain asepcts and make it easier. First, he suggested we change the background of the Menu page to match the Options page because it looked nicer and would match the whole theme of theg ame. Second, he proposed a pause button because he did not see that option. Third, he proposed the mechanics of the game to reset the ball faster when it hits out of bounds because that took quite a bit during levels 1, 2, and 3 when he would go off course.

**Annika Hurst:**
Annika had mixed feelings about the overall game. She methioned multiple times that the UI and graphics were really informative and fun. She had no issues learning to play though
while playing, she said she ran into some problems. Annika talked a lot about how had the game was. When hitting the ball she struggleed to hit with just the right speed. This
would cause the ball to go way out of bounds or on the flip, just a couple inches. She was using a track pad rather then a mouse and further options should be added to adjust for
different play styles/hardware. Lastly Annika menthioned the fact the when aiming, the ball could get lost behind a wall. This could easily be fixed with some future shaders. 


**Summary:**
