## 1. Description


## 2. Verification (Tests)
## 2.1. Unit Test
### 2.1.1
  + We have utilized NUnit testing framework for the C# .NET language. We also utilize TestTools derived from the UnityEngine library to assist in the execution of tests in their respective environment.
### 2.1.2
  + [A link to the tests](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/tree/main/Assets/Tests)
### 2.1.3 
  + An example test case would be testing to see if the correct state change has occured when requested through code. [Here](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/blob/main/Assets/Tests/PlayMode/TestStateChange.cs) is an example of a Play Mode test where we do such a thing.

### Alex Milizia

**Menu:**
- How does the menu look?
  - I like the menu, I think it looks clean and makes you interested in the game.
- What do you think about the color schemes?  What do you think about the animations?
  - I think the color schemes are pretty good, I like the name on top of the screen mostly with the green and purple.
- Is there anything missing in the menu section?
  - No, not that I can think of
- How would you rate the overall ease of use (1 to 10) of the main menu?
  - 10, easy and simple with the only options being start and options
- What could be improved?
  - I think the golfball graphic could be improved, mostly just the lines behind it showing that it’s moving could look cleaner and not just like a shape object plugged in.
- Could you give an overall score of 1-10 and why?
  - 8, it’s simple and works, the logo looks good and I like the background being the map moving around in the back. The only issue imo is the golfball.
 
 
**Game:**
- How does the game look? 
  - The game looks good, I really enjoy the environments on the levels and the variety of them.
- What are your thoughts on the levels (too colorful, too easy, too hard, etc.)?
  - I thought some of the later levels were pretty hard, not that that’s a bad thing but they were pretty difficult
- What could be improved?
  - I think the ball movement could be improved, I feel like it is pretty weird with how it stops and how it will bounce off the hole pretty easily. I also think a strength meter would be beneficial.
- How are the mechanics? Any improvements there?
  - I think the mechanics make sense and are easy to use. Again the strength meter that I believe would help.
- How would you rate the overall ease of use (1 to 10)?
  - 9
- What do you think about the graphics? Any improvements?
  - I think they look fine, again I really enjoy the environment. I did notice some parts of the game aren’t connected all the way, like some places have gaps in them
- Are there any features missing that you expected?
  - no

**Follow-ups:**
- Do you feel like the game is simple to use?
  - Yea
- Do you think we can add anymore to our game?
  - Strength meter for the golf ball
- What additional features/customization options would make this game more user friendly?
  - Maybe like a sound volume option, but I don’t think it’s necessary.
- Any other comments?
  - N/A

## Reflections
**Jacob Kaiser:**
Jacob's feedback primarily focused on the UI and mechanics of the game. While he did not have an issue with the menu or levels, he proposed ideas on how to adjust certain asepcts and make it easier. First, he suggested we change the background of the Menu page to match the Options page because it looked nicer and would match the whole theme of theg ame. Second, he proposed a pause button because he did not see that option. Third, he proposed the mechanics of the game to reset the ball faster when it hits out of bounds because that took quite a bit during levels 1, 2, and 3 when he would go off course.

**Annika Hurst:**
Annika had mixed feelings about the overall game. She methioned multiple times that the UI and graphics were really informative and fun. She had no issues learning to play though
while playing, she said she ran into some problems. Annika talked a lot about how had the game was. When hitting the ball she struggleed to hit with just the right speed. This
would cause the ball to go way out of bounds or on the flip, just a couple inches. She was using a track pad rather then a mouse and further options should be added to adjust for
different play styles/hardware. Lastly Annika menthioned the fact the when aiming, the ball could get lost behind a wall. This could easily be fixed with some future shaders. 

**Sierra Morales***
Sierra's feedback was very constructive and started off with how easy it is to read the text from the menus and the instructions in game. The animations are a "nice tough" Sierra exclaims. She notices that the option menu is missing "actual options" and perhaps customization would be a good fit here. Sierra shared that the game would be better if it had a full screen option. While in the game she noticed that the simple art style was very attractive. The controls were very intuitive and well explained. Then she continues with the later levels can get frustrating due to difficulty and could be made easier. Lastly Sierra explained how she was expecting more of a celebration after scoring a hole.

**Mia Visser**
Mias reaction was mostly positive. She really liked the "funny mascot" that we have in almost all animations throughout the game. She really likes the background music, and says it's calming with a nice beat. She didn't see the second level signs and this caused a bit of frustration in the later harder levels. She also explained the level difficulty increases way too fast. Overall the controls are intuitive and easy to figure out and very rewarding when you get a hole in one!

**Joey Shahnian**
Joey reaction was really positive as he like the game and scenary. He wanted a bit more customization with the ball. He Liked each level designs. He was a bit annoyed with how the sensitivity of the putter being. he wanted at least a sensitivity setting that let hime change it, so the ball could be hit with more precision. Overall though he said he had a fun time playing the game and like it.

**Alex Milizia**
Alex reaction was postive for us. He liked the color scheme we chose for the back round of the menu. He also like the background of the menu being the scene of a level spining. There was a couple of complants from him though. He didnt like the look of the golfball and said it looked to much like a basic game object. He also said that some of the levels were hard but that it not completly bad. He also said the ball physics could be in proved because the ball kept boucning out of the hole. Overall though he said the game was fun and we only relly needed to improve on a couple of small things

##Dr.Amresh##
He was able to understand pretty quickly how the game worked and why some levels are designed the way that they are. But he mostly had issues with the putter mechanic in general since he could not putt the way that he wanted to , and each putt to him was random. He advaocated for a UI to display the putter force and speed so that players can have an easier time with it and also requested for options to change the mouse sens in game.
**Summary:**
