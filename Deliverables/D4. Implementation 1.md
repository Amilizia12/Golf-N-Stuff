### 9. Look & Feel 

We wanted golf and stuff to be a more relaxing  and fun game that you can play while your bored and have nothing to do. For the look we wanted to appeal to that so we have a  more simplistic looking UI with a more cartoony looking tracks. The feel of the game is to try and keep it nice and peaceful with some lofi music playing along side you. We also implented a little putter that will appear when you want to hit the ball. So when you move your mouse to swing you can put your own power into you swing.
