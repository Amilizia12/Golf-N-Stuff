## 1. Introduction
Golf-N-Stuff is a browser-based mini golf simulator that allows office workers and gamers to slack off more efficiently without the need to worry. Having a free minigolf game right in your browser makes it all the more convenient to hide your office shenanigans from prying eyes. With our intuitive and realistic golf controls it makes you feel like you are actually hitting the ball! Golf-N-Stuff offers a realistic and sophisticated golf ball physics system that will leave you in awe as you thwack the ball across the range. The creative level design we hand crafted will keep you captivated through the twists and turns of each course while you procrastinate other important tasks. Lastly with our advanced menu design and quality of life features you can easily pick up a new game or start a specific level. It’s so easy, even a toddler can play.\

### 5. Code quality
  In order for our team to ensure the quality of our code, we implemented multiple methods to keep our code up to standard.
Our first implementation is requiring code review from multiple members of the group before any changes were pushed to our
main branch. The review can include looking over code for bugs, testing functionality, examining the outputs of the code
and if the outcome of the code matches within our goal. If the code that was pushed did not meet the standard, we would
reject the push and refactor until it was ready. \
  Another way we kept our code organized and clean was by discussing as a team how our file hierarchy should be organized. 
We made separate folders dedicated to different categories of files needed for our game to function properly. This is so we 
can keep our code in places that are easy to obtain and manipulate without wasting production time looking for files. \
  Our team also had coding conventions. We all came to an agreement on how our code should be syntactically written so the look
of our code is recognizeable, consistent and readable. We had rules for our curly braces, variable names, file names, class names and 
the spacing of our code. \
  All of the protocols that we have implemented ensured that our code was at the highest standard possible for our game development.
