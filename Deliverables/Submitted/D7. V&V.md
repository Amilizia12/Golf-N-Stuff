## 2. Verification (Tests)
## 2.1. Unit Test
### 2.1.1
  + We have utilized NUnit testing framework for the C# .NET language. We also utilize TestTools derived from the UnityEngine library to assist in the execution of tests in their respective environment.
### 2.1.2
  + [A link to the tests](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/tree/main/Assets/Tests)
### 2.1.3 
  + An example test case would be testing to see if the correct state change has occured when requested through code. [Here](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/blob/main/Assets/Tests/EditMode/TestStateChange.cs) is an example of a Edit Mode test where we do such a thing.
### 2.1.4
  + ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32140838/235332278-2306c8d8-6a29-4c9e-b10e-0adbc95d93e0.png)
## 2.2 Acceptance Test
### 2.2.1
 + We use a testing tool built inside Unity called TestTools to make "Play mode Tests". These are used for acceptance testing such as if controlls are working currectly, if localization is implemented correctly, or if performance is up to expectations.
### 2.2.2
  + [A link to our acceptance tests](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/tree/main/Assets/Tests/PlayMode) 
### 2.2.3
  + An example is proving that the camera movement is behaving correctly and controls are properly given to the player. [Here](https://github.com/Major-Lag98/Golf-N-Stuff/blob/main/Assets/Tests/PlayMode/TestCameraPutter.cs) is an example of a Play Mode test where we check to see if controls are properly given to the player after setup.
### 2.2.4
  + Executing the playmode tests.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32140838/235836353-d9ab80c5-09b6-44bd-9707-559a947db2df.png)

**Menu:**
- How does the menu look?
  - I like the menu, I think it looks clean and makes you interested in the game.

  - No, not that I can think of
- How would you rate the overall ease of use (1 to 10) of the main menu?
  - 10, easy and simple with the only options being start and options

  - I think the golfball graphic could be improved, mostly just the lines behind it showing that it’s moving could look cleaner and not just like a shape object plugged in.
- Could you give an overall score of 1-10 and why?
  - 8, it’s simple and works, the logo looks good and I like the background being the map moving around in the back. The only issue imo is the golfball.
 
 
**Game:**
- How does the game look? 
  - The game looks good, I really enjoy the environments on the levels and the variety of them.

  - I thought some of the later levels were pretty hard, not that that’s a bad thing but they were pretty difficult
- What could be improved?
  - I think the ball movement could be improved, I feel like it is pretty weird with how it stops and how it will bounce off the hole pretty easily. I also think a strength meter would be beneficial.

  - Yea
- Do you think we can add anymore to our game?
  - Strength meter for the golf ball

## Reflections
**Jacob Kaiser:**
Jacob's feedback primarily focused on the UI and mechanics of the game. While he did not have an issue with the menu or levels, he proposed ideas on how to adjust certain asepcts and make it easier. First, he suggested we change the background of the Menu page to match the Options page because it looked nicer and would match the whole theme of theg ame. Second, he proposed a pause button because he did not see that option. Third, he proposed the mechanics of the game to reset the ball faster when it hits out of bounds because that took quite a bit during levels 1, 2, and 3 when he would go off course.

**Annika Hurst:**
Annika had mixed feelings about the overall game. She mentioned multiple times that the UI and graphics were really informative and fun. She had no issues learning to play though
while playing, she said she ran into some problems. Annika talked a lot about how had the game was. When hitting the ball she struggleed to hit with just the right speed. This
would cause the ball to go way out of bounds or on the flip, just a couple inches. She was using a track pad rather then a mouse and further options should be added to adjust for
different play styles/hardware. Lastly Annika menthioned the fact the when aiming, the ball could get lost behind a wall. This could easily be fixed with some future shaders. 

**Sierra Morales:**
Sierra's feedback was very constructive and started off with how easy it is to read the text from the menus and the instructions in game. The animations are a "nice touch" Sierra exclaims. She notices that the option menu is missing "actual options" and perhaps customization would be a good fit here. Sierra shared that the game would be better if it had a full screen option. While in the game, she noticed that the simple art style was very attractive. The controls were very intuitive and well explained. Then, she continues with the later levels can get frustrating due to difficulty and could be made easier. Lastly, Sierra explained how she was expecting more of a celebration after scoring a hole.

**Mia Visser:**
Mia's reaction was mostly positive. She really liked the "funny mascot" that we have in almost all animations throughout the game. She really likes the background music, and says it's calming with a nice beat. She didn't see the second level signs and this caused a bit of frustration in the later harder levels. She also explained the level difficulty increases way too fast. Overall, the controls are intuitive and easy to figure out and very rewarding when you get a hole in one!

**Joey Shahnian:**
Joey's reaction was really positive as he like the game and scenary. He wanted a bit more customization with the ball. He Liked each level design. He was a bit annoyed with how the sensitivity of the putter being. he wanted at least a sensitivity setting that let hime change it, so the ball could be hit with more precision. Overall, though he said he had a fun time playing the game and like it.

**Alex Milizia:**
Alex's reaction was postive for us. He liked the color scheme we chose for the back round of the menu. He also like the background of the menu being the scene of a level spining. There was a couple of complants from him though. He didnt like the look of the golfball and said it looked to much like a basic game object. He also said that some of the levels were hard but that it not completly bad. He also said the ball physics could be in proved because the ball kept boucning out of the hole. Overall, though he said the game was fun and we only relly needed to improve on a couple of small things

**Dr.Amresh:**
He was able to understand pretty quickly how the game worked and why some levels are designed the way that they are. But he mostly had issues with the putter mechanic in general since he could not putt the way that he wanted to, and each putt to him was random. He advaocated for a UI to display the putter force and speed so that players can have an easier time with it and also requested for options to change the mouse sens in game.

**Summary:**

Reviewing the information gathered in these interviews, we can see multiple important topics coming up to the surface that are consistent throughout the interviews. First, let us look at the feedback we received about the menu. We commonly were told that the menu and UI were user friendly, good color scheme, and overall put together. Also, the users loved the animation of the golfball. One improvement about the menu that users said, was to have an actual options menu. This could control the sound, help options, etc. Secondly, we will talk about the actual game that we asked our interviewees to review. In this section, we saw many responses that we were hoping to hear, and many responses we had expected to hear. We saw that people liked the terrain and graphics of each level. They thought it was easy on the eyes. Another thing they liked was the background music. We also encountered responses, while they were not positive, we expected to hear about it. We had mix opinions about level difficulty. Some interviewees thought the levels were good difficulty wise, while others thought the levels were to hard or the difficulty increased to fast per level. One topic that each interviewee mentioned was the physics of the ball and the sensitivity when putting. Some interviewees expressed that the ball would bounce out of the hole or when the putted, it would move the ball just a little. Overall, the review response that we received has been ver promising, showing that we have closely achieved our goal within reasonable standards within the time frame for the project. Meeting our value proposition is a huge thing each member of the team can be proud of.
